There are amazing libraries for NeoPixels like Adafruit_CircuitPython_NeoPixel and Adafruit_CircuitPython_LED_Animation
This is a simple library to show how to use PIO and animations with NeoPixels. Only for use in my own DIY projects at home.
Only tested with a Raspberry Pi Pico and a 16 NeoPixel ring.
